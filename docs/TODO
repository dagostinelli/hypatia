Remaining Work:

- matrix4 Test the identity property I * M = M and also M * I = M
- matrix4 Test the associative property A(BC) == (AB)C
- matrix4 Test the distributive property A(B+C) == AB + AC
- matrix4 Test the lack of commutative property AB != BA (in general)
- Add all the variations of rotations with a matrix using matrix4_set_from_quaternion, matrix4_set_from_axis_angle, matrix4_transformation_rotation_x,y,z
- add a vector to a quat, add each element one by one
- add a scalar to a quat, add the scalar to each element of the quat
- in quat-slerp is the shortest arc properly computed with negate or conjugate?
- is quaternion_dot_product an appropriate operation on a quaternion?
- add a unit test for quaternion inverse that involves a unit (norm == 1) and a non-unit quaternion (norm != 1)
- make doxygen ignore vector3_get_reference_vector3

- Re-test the Visual Studio compilation
	- Postfix is not being applied correctly for MSVC (hypatiad.dll)
	- PDB is not being founds and added to install files (See CPack)
	- PDB is not being collected by AppVeyor artifact collector

- In Visual Studio compilation Fix this: (shouldn't be outputting a lib file for the test project)
	Linking C executable test_hypatia.exe
	   Creating library test_hypatia.lib and object test_hypatia.exp
	   Creating library test_hypatia.lib and object test_hypatia.exp
	[100%] Built target test_hypatia

- CPack is using strange version numbers. Where is it getting those version numbers from?
- AppVeyor is showing CMake warnings that do not appear on other platforms
- TravisCI's Mac machines are not building Doxygen
- Doxygen is throwing warnings (looks like the config file has some obsolete variables -- it was generated to being with)

// end of TODO.txt ...
