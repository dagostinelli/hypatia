CODING STANDARD
---------------
- indent with tabs
- lower case function names for public-facing functions
- all CAPS for public constants.  HYP is the prefix for public constants
- use 'self' for describing the function context
- math entities are mutable (conscious design choice)
- 2 vertical line breaks between functions
- blank line at the end of every file

DESIGN GUIDELINES
-----------------
- drop the suffixes from the functions that use the same type as the prefix (vector3_dosomethingv3 -> vector3_dosomething)
- compare the header files and make sure the names are internally consistent
