Remaining Work:

- Re-test the Visual Studio compilation
- Build a Visual Studio makefile/project file
- Fix this: (shouldn't be outputting a lib file for the test project)
	Linking C executable test_hypatia.exe
	   Creating library test_hypatia.lib and object test_hypatia.exp
	   Creating library test_hypatia.lib and object test_hypatia.exp
	[100%] Built target test_hypatia

- consider renaming the transformation matrix generators to something like "make_transform"
- consider renaming the helper functions like matrix4_scalev3 to something like l_matrix4_scalev3
- Implement: Q20. How do I calculate the inverse of a rotation matrix?
- mat4 Test the identity property I * M = M and also M * I = M
- mat4 Test the associative property A(BC) == (AB)C
- mat4 Test the distributive property A(B+C) == AB + AC
- mat4 Test the lack of commutative property AB != BA (in general)
- Add all the variations of rotations with a matrix using matrix4_set_from_quaternion, matrix4_set_from_axis_angle, matrix4_transformation_rotation_x,y,z
- add a vector to a quat, add each element one by one
- add a scalar to a quat, add the scalar to each element of the quat
- review quaternion_magnitude
- in quat-slerp is the shortest arc properly computed with negate or conjugate?
- is quaternion_dot_product an appropriate operation on a quaternion?
- add a unit test for quaternion inverse that involves a unit (norm == 1) and a non-unit quaternion (norm != 1)
- make doxygen ignore vector3_get_reference_vector3
- drop the suffixes from the functions that use the same type as the prefix (vector3_dosomethingv3 -> vector3_dosomething)
- compare the header files and make sure the names are internally consistent
