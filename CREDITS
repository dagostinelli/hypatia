The Matrix-Quaternion FAQ was extremely helpful as far as teaching me the math. I originally came upon that document a long time ago as a student (I think it was the late 1990's) and had forgotten about it until a friend reintroduced me to it.  I got the feeling at that reintroduction that this document was in danger of being lost at the bottom of the Internet.  I decided to "save it" by including it in this library in the "extras" folder.  If the original authors do not appreciate this, I am happy to remove it.  Keep in mind however that the doc does say: "Feel free to distribute or copy this FAQ as you please." I credit it as a source for some of the routines used in Hypatia and I hereby thank its authors for their hardwork in its creation.

Along the way, I found that some of the terminology used on the Internet concerning quaternions was not consistent.  For example, there is confusion about the difference between a quaternion's "norm", "normalizing a quaternion" and the quaternion's "magnitude".  Not having a formal background in linear algebra, I found things like this very confusing. Part of the reason that I wanted to build this library was to finally learn all of this material for myself; once having done that, share it with others.

When I read through the Mat-Quat FAQ, I found the notes about corrections that were made, but I still found that there were differences between what the doc says, various pages around the Internet say and some math books that I assumed were reliable texts.  I'd like to credit some of those other sources:
